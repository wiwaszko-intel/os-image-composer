# Image-Composer CLI Specification

`image-composer` is a command-line tool for generating custom OS images for
different operating systems including Edge Microvisor toolkit, Azure Linux,
and Wind River eLxr. It provides a flexible, configurability-first approach to creating production-ready OS images with precise customization.

## Overview

Image-Composer uses a single CLI with subcommands to provide a consistent user experience while maintaining flexibility. The tool's architecture is built
around:

1. A global configuration file that defines system-wide settings like cache
locations and provider configurations
2. Image template files (in YAML format) that define per-image build
requirements

The tool follows a staged build process, supporting package caching, image
caching, and various customization options to speed up development cycles and
ensure reproducible builds.

```

The primary workflow is through the `build` command, which reads an image template file, checks if an image matching those specifications is already cached, and either uses the cached image or runs the build pipeline to create a new image.  
**_NOTE:_**  The build pipeline will have package caching mechanism unless instructed to skip in the command option `--no-package-cache`

See also:

details on the caching process

## Usage

```bash
image-composer [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]
```

## Global Options

Image-Composer uses a layered configuration approach, with command-line options
taking priority over configuration file settings:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--config FILE, -c FILE` | Global configuration file (default: /etc/image-composer/config.yaml). This file contains system-wide settings that apply to all image builds. |
| `--work-dir DIR` | Working directory for temporary build files (overrides config). This is where images are constructed before being finalized. |
| `--cache-dir DIR` | Cache directory for packages and previous builds (overrides config). Proper caching significantly improves build times. |
| `--log-level LEVEL` | Log level: debug, info, warn, error (overrides config). Use debug for troubleshooting build issues. |
| `--verbose, -v` | Verbose output (equivalent to --log-level debug). Displays detailed information about each step of the build process. |
| `--quiet, -q` | Minimal output (equivalent to --log-level error). Only displays errors, useful for scripted environments. |
| `--help, -h` | Show help for any command or subcommand. |
| `--version` | Show Image-Composer version information. |

## Commands

### Build Command

Build an OS image from an image template file. This is the primary command for creating custom OS images according to your requirements.

```bash
image-composer build [options] TEMPLATE_FILE
```

Options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--output-dir DIR, -o DIR` | Output directory for the finished image (default: ./output). Final images will be placed here with names based on the template. |
| `--force, -f` | Force overwrite existing files. By default, the tool will not overwrite existing images with the same name. |
| `--keep-temp` | Keep temporary files after build for debugging purposes. These are normally cleaned up automatically. |
| `--parallel N` | Run up to N parallel tasks (default: from config). Increases build speed on multi-core systems. |
| `--stage NAME` | Build up to specific stage and stop (e.g., "packages"). Useful for debugging or when you need a partially-built image. |
| `--skip-stage NAME` | Skip specified stage. Allows bypassing certain build phases when they're not needed. |
| `--timeout DURATION` | Maximum build duration (e.g., 1h30m). Prevents builds from running indefinitely due to issues. |
| `--variables FILE` | Load variables from YAML file to customize the build without modifying the template file. |
| `--set KEY=VALUE` | Set individual variable for the build (can be specified multiple times). |

### Validate Command

Validate an image template file without building it. This allows checking
for errors in your template before committing to a full build process.

```bash
image-composer validate [options] TEMPLATE_FILE
```

Options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--schema-only` | Only validate YAML schema without checking filesystem dependencies or provider compatibility. This performs a quick validation of the syntax only. |
| `--strict` | Enable strict validation with additional checks. Enforces best practices and checks for potential issues that might not cause immediate errors. |
| `--list-warnings` | Show all warnings, including minor issues that might not prevent the build. Helpful for creating more robust template files. |

- [Validate Stage](./image-composer-build-process.md#1-validate-stage) for
details on the validation process

### Cache Command

Manage the image and package caches to optimize build performance and storage
usage.

```bash
image-composer cache SUBCOMMAND
```

Subcommands:

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `list` | List cached images with their metadata, timestamps, and storage locations. Helps you understand what's already cached and available for reuse. |
| `info [hash]` | Show detailed cache info for a specific image hash, including build parameters and template details. |
| `clean [--all\|--packages\|--images]` | Clean cache to reclaim disk space. You can selectively clean either packages or images, or both with --all. |
| `export [hash] FILE` | Export a cached image to a specific file location. Useful when you need to retrieve a specific cached build. |
| `import FILE` | Import an existing image into the cache. Allows pre-populating the cache with images built elsewhere. |

- [Configuration Options](./image-composer-caching.md#configuration-options) for cache configuration

### Template Command

Manage image templates that serve as starting points for customized images.

```bash
image-composer template SUBCOMMAND
```

Subcommands:

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `list` | List available templates with descriptions and supported configurations. Templates provide ready-to-use base configurations for common image types. |
| `show TEMPLATE` | Show template details including all settings, variables, and customization options for a specific template. |
| `create TEMPLATE_FILE` | Create a new template from an existing template file, making it available for future use. |
| `export TEMPLATE FILE` | Export a template to a file for sharing with other users or systems. Templates can be version-controlled and distributed. |

- [Using Templates to Build Images](./image-composer-templates.md#using-templates-to-build-images) for template usage examples

### Provider Command

Manage OS providers used to build images for different operating systems.

```bash
image-composer provider SUBCOMMAND
```

Subcommands:

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `list` | List configured providers with their status and capabilities. Shows all available OS providers that can be used for image building. |
| `config PROVIDER` | Show provider configuration details including repository URLs, tools, and default settings for a specific provider. |
| `test PROVIDER` | Test provider configuration by verifying dependencies and connectivity. Ensures the provider is properly configured before attempting a build. |

```bash
# Build an image with default settings
image-composer build my-image-template.yml

# Build with custom global config
image-composer --config=/path/to/config.yaml build my-image-template.yml

# Build with variable substitution
image-composer build --set "version=1.2.3" --set "hostname=edge-device-001" my-image-template.yml

# Build up to a specific stage
image-composer build --stage configuration my-image-template.yml

# Create a new template from a template file
image-composer template create my-image-template.yml
```

## Configuration Files

### Global Configuration File

The global configuration file (YAML format) defines system-wide settings that apply to all image builds. This centralized configuration simplifies management of common settings across multiple image builds.

```yaml
core:
  # Core system settings
  cache_dir: "/var/cache/image-composer"     # Location for all cached data
  work_dir: "/var/tmp/image-composer"        # Temporary build workspace
  log_level: "info"                          # Default logging verbosity
  max_concurrent_builds: 4                   # Parallel build processes
  cleanup_on_failure: true                   # Auto-cleanup on build errors

storage:
  # Cache storage settings
  package_cache: 
    enabled: true                            # Enable package caching
    max_size_gb: 10                          # Maximum cache size
    retention_days: 30                       # How long to keep cached packages
  image_cache:
    enabled: true                            # Enable image caching
    max_count: 5                             # Number of images to keep per template

providers:
  # OS-specific provider configurations
  azure_linux:
    repositories:
      - name: "base"
        url: "https://packages.microsoft.com/azurelinux/3.0/prod/base/"
    
  elxr:
    repositories:
      - name: "main"
        url: "https://mirror.elxr.dev/elxr/dists/aria/main/"
    
  emt:
    repositories:
      - name: "edge-base"
        url: "https://files-rs.edgeorchestration.intel.com/files-edge-orch/microvisor/rpm/3.0/"
```

See also:

- [Global Options](#global-options) for command-line options that can override
these settings

### Image Template File

The image template file (YAML format) defines the requirements for a
specific image. This is where you define exactly what goes into your custom OS
image, including packages, configurations, and customizations.

```yaml
image:
  # Basic image identification
  name: edge-device-image                    # Name of the resulting image
  version: "1.2.0"                          # Version for tracking and naming

target:
  # Target OS and image configuration
  os: azure-linux                           # Base operating system
  dist: azl3                                 # Distribution identifier
  arch: x86_64                               # Target architecture
  imageType: raw                             # Output format (raw, iso, img, vhd)

systemConfigs:
  # Array of system configurations
  - name: edge                               # Configuration name
    description: Edge device image with Microvisor support  # Human-readable description
    
    # Package configuration
    packages:                                # Packages to install
      - openssh-server
      - docker-ce
      - vim
      - curl
      - wget
    
    # Kernel configuration
    kernel:
      version: "6.12"                        # Kernel version to include
      cmdline: "quiet splash"                # Additional kernel command-line parameters
```

## Exit Codes

The tool provides consistent exit codes that can be used in scripting and
automation:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 | Success - The command completed successfully |
| 1 | General error - An unspecified error occurred |
| 2 | Command line usage error - Invalid options or arguments |
| 3 | Validation error - The template file failed validation |
| 4 | Build error - The build process failed |
| 5 | Configuration error - Error in configuration files |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Disk Space**: Building images requires significant temporary disk space.

   ```bash
   # Check free space
   df -h /var/tmp/image-composer
   ```

1. **Cache Corruption**: If you experience unexplained failures, try clearing
the cache.

   ```bash
   image-composer cache clean --all
   ```

### Logging

For detailed logs to troubleshoot issues:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
image-composer --log-level debug build my-image-template.yml

# Save logs to a file
image-composer --log-level debug build my-image-template.yml 2>&1 | tee build-log.txt
```
