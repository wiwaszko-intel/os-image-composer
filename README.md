The Image Composer Tool (ICT) is a toolchain that enables building immutable
Linux distributions using a simple toolchain from pre-built packages emanating
from different Operating System Vendors (OSVs).

The ICT is developed in `golang` and is initially targeting to build custom
images for [EMT](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit)
(Edge Microvisor Toolkit), [Azure Linux](https://github.com/microsoft/azurelinux)
and WindRiver Linux.
